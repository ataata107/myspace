			"Created an autonomous robot that can precisely track and follow people by observing their facial motions. used the Dlib Deep Learning library to achieve accurate real-time facial coordinate detection.Â Used the extracted facial coordinates as input data for a Raspberry Pi-based PID controller. Transmitted the controller's outputs to servo motors, allowing the robot to track and follow a detected face precisely and autonomously, increasing tracking accuracy by 30%.",

		description:
			"I actively collaborated within a team to assemble a quadcopter, employing Arduino as the primary flight controller. The project involved incorporating sensor feedback from components such as the gyroscope and pressure sensors to achieve optimal stability, resulting in an impressive 15-minute flight time. This hands-on experience significantly enhanced my understanding of flight dynamics and control systems. In addition to the quadcopter project, I took the lead in constructing a line-following drone equipped with Pixhawk as the flight controller. This innovative drone demonstrated the capability to autonomously track a yellow line by processing feedback from a camera, LIDAR, and a flow sensor. The successful integration of this data into a PID controller facilitated seamless automation, highlighting my proficiency in drone design and autonomous navigation systems.",

			"I concurrently captured images from RGB and thermal cameras to create a dataset for object recognition, eliminating the need for manual annotation. The thermal images were annotated by cross-referencing them with corresponding RGB images using the YOLO algorithm. Subsequently, I trained the annotated thermal images using a Single Shot Detector and conducted real-time inference on an NVIDIA Jetson with live thermal feed, enhancing visibility by 25 meters in low-light conditions.",
